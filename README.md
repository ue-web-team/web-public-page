# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies using yarn as this seems to be the most stable option

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

```

## Envs
add an .env file in the project root and add your storyblok api key

```bash
NUXT_PUBLIC_STORYBLOK_API_TOKEN=<your storyblok api key>

```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn preview
```
